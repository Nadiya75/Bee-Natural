    <p class="main_content">There is quite a variety of honey and each flavor and color will depend on the source of the nectar bees have gathered. Popular honeys include wildflower, buckwheat, and clover honey. There is even eucalyptus honey, which offers the slight flavor of menthol. Honey colors are graded by numbers, with the highest number indicating the darkest color. Honey is also valued by granulation, which is the time it takes the honey to crystalize, or granulate. Unfiltered raw honey will granulate faster than filtered. Granulated honey can be made liquid again with a hot water bath.        <br>

Flowering plants appeared on Earth nearly 130 million years ago. It took several million more years for bees to arrive. To date, the oldest fossilized honeycomb dates back three million years. Humans have been using honey for thousands of years. In Spain, an ancient cave drawing shows a human removing honey from a hive, a painting which dates as far back as 15,000 years.
